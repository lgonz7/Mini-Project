# Mini-Project
COMP 383 mini-project. Create a wrapper to integrate and execute the automation of software tools. 


Problem 1:  
Retrieve the Illumina reads for the resequencing of K-12 project:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX5005282. These are single-end Illumina reads. Your code will
retrieve this file; i.e., you cannot just retrieve it.

For this you will need to install the SRA Toolkit to the machine you are using. You can refer to this link to guide you through the installation process, https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit
